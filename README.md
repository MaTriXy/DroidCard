Missing Strings
====

----
Some strings have not been loaded since they contained personal data, but here's a list of them with an explanation of what they do:
* **name**: *your name*, as appears in the card
* **job**: *your job*, that will be written below your name
* **curriculum_url**: this is where you store your Curriculum Vitae, it will be launched when the name card gets *clicked*
* **url_to_share**: this is the link that you will be able to share with the *share* button, I used it to share a *hub page* that contains all my social links
* **url_to_vcard**: *direct URL* to your vCard, will be shared via NFC

####Note: you can change those links and use them as you wish, and you can easily change images and icons from *res* folder.
